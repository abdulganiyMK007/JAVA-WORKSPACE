/*
When two points in time are compared, each given as hours (in military time, ranging from 0 and 23) and minutes, the following pseudocode determines which comes first. 

If hour1 < hour2 
	time1 comes first. 
Else if hour1 and hour2 are the same 
	If minute1 < minute2 
		time1 comes first. 
	Else if minute1 and minute2 are the same 
		time1 and time2 are the same. 
	Else 
		time2 comes first. 
Else 
	time2 comes first.
	
	
Write a program that prompts the user for two points in time and prints the time that comes first, then the other time. In your program, supply a class Time and a method public int compareTo(Time other) that returns â€“1 if the time comes before the other, 0 if both are the same, and 1 otherwise.
