Write a program that reads a number between 1,000 and 999,999 from the user, where the user enters a comma in the input. Then print the number without a comma. Here is a sample dialog; the user input is in color: Please enter an integer between 1,000 and 999,999: 23,456 23456 Hint: Read the input as a string. Measure the length of the string. Suppose it contains n characters. Then extract substrings consisting of the first n â€“ 4 characters and the last three characters.
