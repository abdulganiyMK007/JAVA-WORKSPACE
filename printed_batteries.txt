Soon you may reach for a compact disc in your local record store and, as you touch it, the package will start playing one of the songs on the disc. Or you may stop to look at a product because the package begins to glow as you pass it in the store. These effects
could happen soon thanks to the invention of a flexible, 
superthin battery that can actually be printed onto
the package. This battery was developed by Power
Paper, Ltd., a company founded by Baruch Levanon
and several colleagues.
The battery developed by Power Paper consists
of five layers of zinc (anode) and manganese dioxide
(cathode) and is only 0.5 millimeter thick. The battery
can be printed onto paper with a regular printing press
and appears to present no environmental hazards.
The new battery has been licensed by International Paper Company, 
which intends to use it to bring
light, sound, and other special effects to packaging to
entice potential customers. You might see talking,
singing, or glowing packages on the shelves within a
year or two.
