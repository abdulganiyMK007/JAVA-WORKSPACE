The periodic table of the elements has undergone significant c
hanges since Mendeleev published his first version in 1869. In
 particular, in the past 60 years we haveadded 20 new elements
 beyond uranium. These so-calledtransuranium elements all have
 been synthesized using particle accelerators.Edwin M. McMilla
n and Phillip H. Abelson succeededin synthesizing the first tr
ansuranium element, neptunium(element 93), at the University o
f California, Berkeley, in1940. In 1941, Glenn T. Seaborg synt
hesized and identifiedelement 94 (plutonium), and over the nex
t several years,researchers under his direction at UC Berkeley
 discoverednine other transuranium elements. In 1945 Seaborg s
uggested that the elements heavier than element 89 (actinium)w
ere misplaced as transition metals and should be relocatedon t
he periodic table in a series below the transition metals(the 
actinide series). Seaborg was awarded a Nobel Prize inchemistr
y in 1951 for his contributions.
