The periodic table of the elements has undergone significant 
changes since Mendeleev published his first version in 1869. 
In particular, in the past 60 years we have
added 20 new elements beyond uranium. These so-called
transuranium elements all have been synthesized using particle accelerators.
Edwin M. McMillan and Phillip H. Abelson succeeded
in synthesizing the first transuranium element, neptunium
(element 93), at the University of California, Berkeley, in
1940. In 1941, Glenn T. Seaborg synthesized and identified
element 94 (plutonium), and over the next several years,
researchers under his direction at UC Berkeley discovered
nine other transuranium elements. In 1945 Seaborg suggested that the elements heavier than element 89 (actinium)
were misplaced as transition metals and should be relocated
on the periodic table in a series below the transition metals
(the actinide series). Seaborg was awarded a Nobel Prize in
chemistry in 1951 for his contributions.
